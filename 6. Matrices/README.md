# Matrices

## Diagonal Matrices
Diagonal Matrix is a matrix where all elements other than diagonal must be zero.

> As all other elements are zero, then we need not to take two dimentions to store the matrix, then the storing 0's is just a wastage of memory.

## Lower and Upper Triangular Matrices
In lower and upper triangular matrices the row major and column major formulaes are interchanged, rest remains same so there is no coding for upper triangular matrix.
