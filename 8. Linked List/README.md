# Linked List

## Why Linked List

* Array is of a fixed size. Whenever we are creating an array we have to mention the size which cant be changed further.
* Also, dynamic arrays are availabe but they also make the user decide the number of elements at the execution time and cant be modified accordingly.

So, to solve we have the concept of linked list which can grow and shrink in size accordingly. We use pointers to link the allocated memory in the heap.

**Linked List** is a collection of nodes where each node containd a data and pointer to next node, and a pointer points on first node. Pointer pointing to first node is usually called *head*. Last node will not point to any-node, thus pointing to *NULL.*
